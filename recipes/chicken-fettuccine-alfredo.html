    <h3>Fettuccine pasta that is doused in <em>creamy</em> alfredo sauce and mixed with chicken</h3>
    <div class="time">
        Time: 25 mins
    </div>
    <p>Yield: 4 servings</p>
    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>12 ounces fettuccine</li>
        <li>Olive oil, for tossing</li>
        <li>12 ounces boneless, skinless chicken breast (about 2)</li>
        <li>1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
        <li>2 pinches freshly grated nutmeg</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil, and salt generously. Add the pasta and cook according to package directions until al dente (tender but still slightly firm). Drain and toss with a splash of oil.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, slice the chicken into 1/4-inch-thick strips, and lay them on a plate or a sheet of waxed paper. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add 2 tablespoons of the butter. When the butter melts, raise the heat to medium-high and add the chicken in 1 layer. Cook, without moving the pieces, until the underside has browned, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip the pieces, and cook until browned and cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes more. Transfer the chicken to a medium bowl.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to medium. Add the remaining 6 tablespoons butter. Scrape the bottom of the skillet with a wooden spoon to release any browned bits. When the butter has mostly melted, whisk in the cream and nutmeg and bring to a simmer, then cook for 2 minutes. Lower the heat to keep the sauce just warm.</li>
        <li>Whisk the Parmigiano-Reggiano into the sauce. Add the chicken and cooked pasta and toss well. Season with salt and pepper. Serve hot in heated bowls.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Chef's Note:</h4>Don't worry if it seems like there is too much sauce. As soon as everything is tossed together, the sauce will start to cling to the pasta and <strong><em>thicken</em></strong> before your eyes!
